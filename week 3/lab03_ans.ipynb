    "In this task, we will practise writing *vectorised* code with NumPy arrays, without using any loops.\n",
    "Assume that `v` and `u` are NumPy matrices of the same size, composed of **a single row** (*e.g.*, $(1.1, 2.1, 0.4, 3.2, 1.4, 9.2)$).\n",

    "- Create the `v` and `u` variables first and use them to help you check that your answer is correct. For that purpose, you can use the NumPy's random array generation function `np.random.random` *e.g.*, `row_vector = np.random.random((1,10))`.\n",
    "- For task 3.1.b, you can run the loop-based code to check if both solutions give the same values. If you do so, please do not forget to make copies of the matrices, as **the code overwrites** them.\n",
    "- To make a copy of an array (to avoid one being overwritten) you can use NumPy's `array` constructor: *e.g.*, `copy_of_the_array = np.array(original_array)`. It has a default parameter `copy=True`. Alternatively, you can directly use `copy_of_the_array = original_array.copy()`.\n",
